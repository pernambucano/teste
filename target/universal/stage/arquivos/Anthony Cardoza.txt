Anthony Cardoza
Anthony "Tony" Cardoza (born 1930 in Hartford, Connecticut, US) is an American actor and film producer. He has worked on over a dozen films, but is perhaps best known for his three collaborations with Coleman Francis in the 1960s: The Beast of Yucca Flats, The Skydivers, and Red Zone Cuba.
Before becoming involved in the film industry, Cardoza was a Staff Sgt. in the U.S. Army 3rd infantry division, being a Sgt. Gunner on the 105mm Howitzer in the Korean War. He was awarded two Bronze Battle Stars, the Good Conduct Medal, Korean War Medal, Sharp Shooters medal, Presidents Medal, The Sygmond Rhee Presidential Medal, The Asian War Medal, and others. Just prior to his Honorable Discharge, he was assigned to escort duty (escorting deceased soldiers to their loved ones).
After his discharge, Cardoza worked for Pratt & Whitney Aircraft in East Hartford, Connecticut, as a Heliarc welder on J-57 Jet engines, a trade he continued making a living from for a number of years into his show business career. However, in 1963, a doctor advised him to stop welding because of chalazion forming under his eyelids.
His work would be remembered in the 1990s TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000, as 4 of his 5 movies would be lampooned – his three collaborations with Coleman Francis, and The Hellcats (1967).
