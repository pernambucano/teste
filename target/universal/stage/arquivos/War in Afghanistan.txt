War in Afghanistan
War in Afghanistan, or sometimes termed Afghan War, is the bane of many would-be conquerors and would-be peacemakers. The British had a conceit of "the Great Game", which involved pitting various countries against one another, especially in the Afghanistan area. The United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States all struggled there.
Warfare in Afghanistan has always been difficult to conclude besides by complete withdrawal. The nation's mountainous terrain and generally sparse population allows for guerilla warfare. Unlike some other mountainous nations, Afghanistan's location and routes through it have been considered strategic.
