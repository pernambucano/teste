Battle of Huamantla
The Battle of Huamantla was a U.S. victory late in the Mexican-American War that forced the Mexican Army to lift the Siege of Puebla.


Background
Santa left Puebla at the end of Sept., to intercept Joseph Lane's relief column, planning an ambush at Paso del Pintal. Learning of Santa Anna's men at Huamantla, Lane left his train under guard and marched toward that city, Captain Samuel H. Walker's four companies of cavalry in the lead.


Battle
Walker charged, upon seeing Santa Anna's lancers, driving the Mexicans from the town. Santa Anna led a counterattack, Walker was shot by a civilian in a nearby house, and his men retreated into a church. The Mexicans then retreated to Quer√©taro.
Lane turned his troops loose in a drunken sack of the town. They reached Puebla on 12 Oct. to lift the siege.
