List of primary and secondary sources on the Cold War
This is an English language bibliography of scholarly books and articles on the Cold War. Because of the extent of the Cold War (in terms of time and scope), the conflict is well documented.
The Cold War (Russian: холо́дная война́, kholodnaya voĭna) was the continuing state from roughly 1946 to 1991 of political conflict, military tension, proxy wars, and economic competition between the Communist World — primarily the Soviet Union and its satellite states and allies — and the powers of the Western world, primarily the United States and its NATO allies.
