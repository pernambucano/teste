Battle of Blair's Landing
The Battle of Blair's Landing was fought on April 12, 1864, in Red River Parish, Louisiana, as a part of the Red River Campaign of the American Civil War.


Battle
After the Battle of Pleasant Hill on April 9, Brig. Gen. Tom Green led his men to Pleasant Hill Landing on the Red River, where, about 4:00 p.m. on April 12, they discovered grounded and damaged Union transports and gunboats, the XVI and XVII Corps river transportation, and U.S. Navy gunboats, with supplies and armament aboard. Troops from Union Brig. Gen. Thomas Kilby Smith's Provisional Division, XVII Corps, and the Navy gunboats furnished protection for the army transports. Green and his men charged the boats. When Green attacked, Smith's men used great ingenuity in defending the boats and dispersing the enemy. Hiding behind bales of cotton, sacks of oats, and other ersatz obstructions, the men on the vessels, along with the Navy gunboats, repelled the attack, killed Green, and savaged the Confederate ranks. The Confederates withdrew and most of the Union transports continued downriver. On April 13, at Campti, other boats ran aground and came under enemy fire from Brig. Gen. St. John Richardson Liddell's Sub-District of North Louisiana troops, which harassed the convoy throughout April 12â€“13. The convoy rendezvoused with Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks's army at Grand Ecore, providing the army with badly needed supplies.
