Biography
Born in Bayou Goula, Iberville parish, Louisiana, first cousin of engineer and Governor Paul Octave Hébert, Louis Hébert graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1845, resigned his commission in 1847 to run his ailing father's plantation, and like his cousin became a state militia officer and chief engineer of the state of Louisiana (1855–1860).
Commissioned Colonel of the 3rd Louisiana Infantry, Hébert fought with his regiment at Wilson's Creek and led Benjamin McCulloch's infantry brigade at the Pea Ridge, where Hébert was captured. After prisoner exchange, Hébert was appointed brigadier general in late May 1862, leading a brigade at Iuka, as well as Corinth and Vicksburg. At the last battle he was again made a prisoner of war. He was, however, again paroled. He then served in rebel operations in North Carolina as chief engineer of the department, and commanded the heavy artillery at Fort Fisher.
After the war Hébert was an editor and publisher of a local St. Martin's parish newspaper and taught at several private schools. He died in 1901. Because his burial site was located on private land, with assistance from the Sons of Confederate Veterans in October 2002 his remains were disinterred and moved to St. Joseph's cemetery in nearby Cecilia.
