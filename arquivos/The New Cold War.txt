The New Cold War
See Cold War II -- also known as "the [or "a"] new Cold War" -- for the tensions and actions in the build-up to and wake of the 2014–15 ethnic Russian military actions in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.

The New Cold War: Putin's Russia and the Threat to the West, a 2008 book by Edward Lucas
The New Cold War may also refer to:
The New Cold War: Moscow v. Pekin, a 1963 book by Edward Crankshaw
