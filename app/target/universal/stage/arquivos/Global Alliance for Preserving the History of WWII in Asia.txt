Global Alliance for Preserving the History of WWII in Asia
This page is about the World War II organization. For the modern United Nations organization, see Global Alliance for ICT and Development.
Global Alliance For Preserving the History of WWII in Asia is a non-profit, non-partisan federation of over 40 grassroots organizations dedicated to the remembrance, redress and reconciliation concerning World War II in Asia, also known as the Pacific War. It is concerned with crimes committed by the Imperial Japanese Army on issues like the Nanjing Massacre, Unit 731, Comfort Women, Prisoners of War and Forced Labor. It aims at bringing together such groups electronically, organizationally, and personally. This federation has become increasingly recognized as the leading organization safeguarding humanity and international justice with relation to World War II and its aftermath. It is also the first organization of its kind since previous similar groups focused on some aspect only.


History
Global Alliance has been a collective effort of active scholars and educators around the world interested in the movement of redress and reparation for victims of Imperial Japan during World War II. In 1988, Professor Tien-wei Wu of Southern Illinois University, started publishing a bilingual quarterly focusing on the studies of Japanese aggression against China. The journal, Jih-pen ch'in-Hua yen-chiu, has been criticized by the academia as being "anti-Japanese." Wu himself caused controversy when he made the "profoundly insensitive" claim that Japanese brutalities in China made "the Auschwitz gas chambers appear humane." 
Mr. Andrew H. K. Tu., a senior educator in Hong Kong, however, was a strong supporter of such publication, while Professor Yue Him-Tam of Macalester College was founding editor. In 1990, under the leadership of Mr. Tu and Professor Wu, the first International Conference on Sino-Japanese Relations During the Last Century was convened in Hong Kong, of which Professor Tam was the secretary general. In 1994, Global Alliance officially started with a secretariat in San Francisco. Mr. Tu was elected the first president.


Mission and goals
Global Alliance's mission focuses on bringing about the proper closure of unresolved issues arising from Japan’s aggression that led to World War II in Asia and the Pacific. It seeks justice for victims through punishment of those criminals that were either never put on trial or set free without fulfilling their sentence. Furthermore, it asks war reparations to be given to such victims that have been neglected for over five decades.
Besides reparation and redress, members of Global Alliance seek to preserve and disseminate the true story of the war. Revisionist theories have focused on the denial of such massacres as the Rape of Nanjing, and the actual events that took place during the war are largely unknown in Japan and the West. To address this issue, the organization has worked towards building a memorial museum in the U.S. similar to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to preserve the truth of atrocities during World War II. Finally, Global Alliance advocates expanded coverage of World War II history in the public school textbooks, and has promoted the inclusion of material on the Asian experience of the war. Prevalent focus has been given to the European experience, which was not the only region suffering large losses during the war.


Beliefs
The federation believes that historical truth will bring about justice for victims and safeguard humanity from repeating mistakes from the past. The following beliefs summarize Global Alliance's ideology:
A full accounting of the Asia-Pacific War is imperative with relation to Japanese Government’s factions that foster collective amnesia and ultra-nationalism, justifying and whitewashing Japanese war crimes
Crimes against humanity were committed on a grand scale during this time period
Victims are still seeking justice after nearly 60 years of the war’s end
A nation who forgets the past is condemned to repeat its mistakes
Embrace a feeling of sympathy and friendship with the people of Japan, for they too have been victims of Japanese militarism
Transfer Confucius’ Golden Rule to an international scale: Nations shall not do unto other countries what they would not want others do unto themselves


Demands
Based on the premise that the Government of Japan has to honor its post-war responsibilities, Global Alliance demands that through legislation enacted by the Diet of Japan, the Government of Japan must:
Offer an official and unequivocal apology acknowledging the commission of atrocities in China, Korea, and other Asian states during the Asia-Pacific War
Authorize full disclosure and preservation of documents relating to the mentioned events
Mandate inclusion and teaching at all levels of schooling lessons of humanity learned from Japan’s wars of aggression and its related war crime issues in the first half of the 20th century
Provide just and due compensation to all identified surviving victims and surviving family members of the deceased victims, and victims whose properties were looted and/or destroyed
Amend all statutory limitations under Japanese laws to make them non-applicable to war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Japanese Imperial Forces during the Asia-Pacific War such that victims could seek due redress in the courts of Japan
Provide funding for the creation of a memorial museum in Tokyo dedicated to: the commemoration and remembrance of war victims of the Asia-Pacific War, the preservation of documents declassified, research and publication of information pertaining to all facets of the war, educational outreach focusing on lessons learned through war crimes and related issues of this period, and to the efforts to bring closure to this war and to prevent future wars of aggression
Outlaw public denial of war crimes committed by the Imperial Japanese Army
Prosecute the living Japanese war criminals that have escaped international war crime trials after the end of the war, such as the International Military Tribunal for the Far East
Remove relics of all war criminals now enshrined in the Yasukuni Shrine and prohibit honoring and worshiping of war criminals in that Shrine or any other religious establishments of national significance
Establish a national day of remembrance for victims of the Asia-Pacific War
Return all looted national treasures, including cultural and historical relics
Honor the "military monetary certificates" issued by the Japanese occupational authorities for which people of victimized countries were forced to exchange their national currencies with due interest payment and adjustment for inflation

Related events
In 2000, a resolution ordering Japan to apologize and compensate victims of war crimes committed during World War II was proposed to the U.S. House of Representatives. The resolution included measures for comfort women, Korean women forced into providing sex to the Japanese Army. Congressman Lane Evans - Illinois' 13th congressional district - submitted the resolution to the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, formerly known as the International Relations Committee, on June 19 for consideration during the 106th Congress in September. This resolution is the second of its kind, following one submitted by Congressman William Lipinski- Illinois' 3rd congressional district - in July 1997. The resolution was passed on to the International Relations Committee’s Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, but was later scrapped when congressmen delayed resolutions, fearing damage to relations with Japan.
In 2006, two members of the United States Congress, Representative Lane Evans (D-Illinois) and Representative Chris Smith (R-New Jersey), have introduced a non-binding resolution (H.Res. 759) in the current congressional session which calls on the government of Japan to "formally acknowledge and accept responsibility for its sexual enslavement of young women" during the 1930s and 40s.
