Expeditionary tank
The Expeditionary tank was a United States light tank developed for the Armored Gun System competition in the 1980s by Teledyne Vehicle Systems (now L3 Communications Combat Propulsion Systems).


DevelopmentEdit
In the late seventies Teledyne Vehicle Systems carried out several studies on a highly mobile light tracked vehicle, which could be used for a variety of tasks. The in-house trials lasted from 1980 to 1981. In 1982, a detailed design had been decided on. This vehicle competed in the Armored Gun System (AGS) competition. The first prototype was completed in December 1983, the turret was completed mid-1984. In October of the year took place in the Nevada test center mobility and reliability testing, in April 1985 the chassis and turret were united. A month later, in May, the vehicle was presented for the first time at the U.S. Army Armor Conference at Fort Knox. A 1986 test firing took place. In 1992, the Expeditionary tank lost the AGS competition to United Defense's CCV-L which was type classified as the M8 Armored Gun System. The Expeditionary tank was later solicited to other nations by Teledyne and later General Dynamics but was never bought.


DesignEdit


MobilityEdit
The tank would have been transported by a C-130 Hercules or C-141 Starlifter. To ensure a high level of protection despite the low weight of the front end of the vehicle there was an armored crew chamber, behind which the drive block was placed. The vehicle was operated by a two-man crew, both positioned in the chassis. The driver sits at the front left. The tank was to be equipped with a double bottom to better the survivability from mines.


LegacyEdit
The turret developed for this vehicle is used on the M1128 Mobile Gun System. The autoloader was problematic and required a redesign.
