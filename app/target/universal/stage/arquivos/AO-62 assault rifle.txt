AO-62 assault rifle
The AO-62 is a 5.45×39mm calibre assault rifle that led to the development of the AN-94 Abakan assault rifle. It is recoil operated with a special device that can resist recoil when the first three rounds are fired. This rifle predates the similarly operated Heckler & Koch G11 and AN-94 assault rifles.
