List of military conflicts spanning multiple wars
Early histories of a war typically describe the war as it was declared by the states involved. It is not uncommon for later historians to group together a series of wars over a long period or spread over several theaters as part of a broader conflict or strategic campaign. The most familiar of these in the present day is probably the Cold War, which included the Soviet occupation of Europe versus European Resistance movements, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Soviet war in Afghanistan to name a few wars during the cold war. These groupings provide useful context for the wars involved. Note that some groupings overlap time periods and its possible for more than one war to be going on at the same time.
